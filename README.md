## Chrysaor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LebedevRI/chrysaor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LebedevRI/chrysaor)

In Greek mythology, Chrysaor (Greek: Χρυσάωρ, Khrusaōr, gen.: Χρυσάορος; English translation: "He who has a golden sword" (from χρυσός, "golden" and ἄορ, "sword")), the brother of the winged horse Pegasus, was often depicted as a young man, the son of Poseidon and the Gorgon Medusa. Chrysaor and Pegasus were not born until Perseus chopped off Medusa's head.

Testbed, attempt to implement and explore *Powered Explicit Guidance Ascent System*, in short - PEGAS.
PEGAS can be seen as a short for Pegasus, and Chrysaor is the brother of the Pegasus, thus the name.
